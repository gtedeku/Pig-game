Welcome to Pig Game, a simple yet entertaining dice game implemented in JavaScript. This repository contains the code for a browser-based Pig Game where players can roll a dice, hold their score, switch between players, and start a new game with ease.

How to Play:

Roll the Dice: Click the "Roll" button to roll the dice. Each roll accumulates points based on the numbers rolled, except for '1'.
Hold Your Score: Click the "Hold" button to secure your current points and add them to your total score. Be strategic and avoid rolling a '1' to keep your points safe!
Switch to the Next Player: After holding your score or rolling a '1', it's time to switch to the next player. The game automatically switches between players, keeping track of scores as you go.
Start a New Game: Finished playing or want to start fresh? Simply click the "New Game" button to reset the game and begin anew.
Game Rules:

Rolling a '1' ends your turn, and you lose all points accumulated in that round.
Holding your score adds your current round's points to your total score, securing them for the game.
The first player to reach the designated score goal wins the game!
